# Awesome-Resume-Editor
This is my first self-developed Android Application that is used to edit your resume via Android devices. 
The main screen of this application contains four parts: Basic Info, Education, Experience and Project. 
You can add new parts by clicking on the "add" button, or edit already defined parts by clicking on the "edit" button. 
When clicking on those buttons, the application will switch to the editing screen. 
When done editing, simply clicking on the "save" button to return back to the main screen. 
You will be able to see your updated resume displayed on the main screen. 
When you close the application, all data will automatically be saved onto local disk. 
When you reopen it next time, you can view all your data as usual.
